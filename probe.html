					<h2>NovoProbe: Revolutionary Endoscope from Concept to FDA-Approved Medical Device in Six Months</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="caseBody">
					<p>Manish Ingle is a seasoned consultant and medical professional who came to Novo Product Labs with an idea for a revolutionary medical device. Manish wanted to drastically improve the standard endoscope with better lighting, better display equipment, introduce antibacterial properties, and reduce the cost of components and was mid-way through development of a device he called the NovoProbe 3000 that he hoped would accomplish all of these objectives.</p>
					<p>With the assistance of Novo, Manish finalized his 3D design. Then, prototypes were created VIA laser cutting, 3D Printing, custom circuit assembly, and purchasing existing components. Within six months of partnering with Novo, Manish settled on a final design that both looked professional and had better performance than any competing endoscope on the market.</p>
					<p>After completion of the NovoProbe 3000, Manish submitted his device to the FDA for approval and waited to hear back. Some time passed and Manish began to doubt his prospects, but then a letter from the FDA arrived allowing him to go ahead and start selling the worldâ€™s best endoscope U.S.-wide.</p>
